IMPROVEMENT 1 - Priority Queue
When reading in the file, each task should generate it's bottom level time.
Task class can then implement comparable and thus the Tasks can be put into a priority queue.
The priority queue will sort the tasks such that the longest bottom level times are first.
variable freeTasks in the algorithm gets replaced with the priority queue.

IMPROVEMENT 2 - Cost function
In the first "if" clause, instead of comparing the makespan of partial schedule
directly with bound, pass it into a cost function first.

IMPROVEMENT 3 - Remove equivalent schedules.
No idea how to do this yet.

IMPROVEMENT OTHER - Optimise Schedule class.
We will figure out how to do this together tomorrow.
